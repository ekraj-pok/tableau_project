# Trend Global Trade

This project involves gathering data on global trade patterns from the [Intracen.org](https://intracen.org/resources#data-and-analysis-1) website, and analyzing it to extract insights on trends in the global trade market. 

## Data Source

The data for this project was gathered from the [Intracen.org](https://intracen.org/resources#data-and-analysis-1) website. It includes data on the value of international trade flows from various countries and regions.

## Technologies Used

For this project, Python `pandas` library has been used to clean and transform the data, and `Tableau` to create interactive visualizations to help us better understand the data.

## Usage

This project is intended for anyone interested in the global economy and trade patterns. By analyzing the data on global trade flows, which countries and regions are dominant in certain industries (i.e: goods and serviese), and how trade patterns are changing over time.

## Further Research

In future research, I would like to study the usage of currency and analyze the trend by various products, and investigate whether there are any changes in the dominance of certain currencies or products over time. This could provide valuable insights into the global economic landscape and help predict future trends in international trade.
